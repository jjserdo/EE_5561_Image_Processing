## Several ways to transform images
1. amplitudes
2. image spatial coordinates
3. linear transformation and non-linear transformation (clipping)
--!--! I think this is what I'm doing with my velocity for propagation

1. Translation
$$f(x-x_0,y-y_0)$$
2. Mirroring 
$$f(-x,-y)$$
3. Zooming In
4. Rotation
$$xc-ys,xs+yc$$
$$x' = rcos(a+t)=r(coscos-sinsin)$$
$$y'=rsin(a+t)$$
5. Warping 
$$f(T_x(x,y),T_y(x,y))$$
$$T_x,T_y:R^2 --> R$$
- imaging morphing and : AI is good at this
