### Dirac Impulse
1. Sifting property
2. Sampling property
--> integrate dirac = 1
--> earlier signals and systems courses
- std = 0
3. symmetric
4. 0 everywhere except at centered
5. approximations example with gaussian

## 2D Systems
input image --> image formation system --> output image
formation system like a camera, CT scanner or MRI
- want g to be as close possible to f

input could be blurry or noisy
image processing - design parameters
image output - can be enhanced or analyzed image
### Properties
1. Amplitude based
	1. linearity, stability, invertibility, etc.
2. Spatial based
	1. causality, separability
3. Stability
	1. bounded-input bounded output stabile
	2. if all bounded inputs produces a bounded output
		1. there existst
4. Invertibility
	1. output signalllcorresponds to only one input signatiion
	2. INjection, Subjection, Bijection
