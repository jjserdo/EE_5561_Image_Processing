improve contrasts to make it easier to be seen
don't want to make the hair white 
P(X<x) = F_X(x)
You would want something that is closer to a random variable so it is more uniform across the whole scale
map an old value to a new value
it becomes more spread out
what we are transforming is the CDF which is the cumulative count
want a linear CDF
making it more normalized can also make it worse
bimode because there are two main humps
