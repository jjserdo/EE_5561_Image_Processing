Normed space
- L1 norm = 2 + 1
- L2 norm = sqrt(2^2+1^2)

Linear Transform
- in the computer store as a matrix
- but can convert into a vector
- in theory is able to convert into a linear operator

Special matrices:
- hermitian transpose is the conjugate transpose
- ![[Pasted image 20230926134038.png]]
- circulant matrix implements the circular convolution
	- because the convolution in image space is the multiplication in fourier space

Solving linear equations
- for underdetermined there are infinite solutions
