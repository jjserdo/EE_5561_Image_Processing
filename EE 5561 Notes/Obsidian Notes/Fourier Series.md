Slide 5 
- function x conjugate is close to inner product; establish orthogonality
Slide 6 
- Kronecker delta: yay this seems familiar which is in fluids 1 and continuum mechanics
- dot product does produce a kronecker delta wow
- can have $g(x,y)$ in terms of basis elements because of orthogonality
Slide 8 
- comb function is a bunch of spikes and looks like a comb
Slide 12 and 13
